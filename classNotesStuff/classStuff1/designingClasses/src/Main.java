        // Specification -> What are my public interfaces

        // Usage Scenarios -> Where is it being used (What parameters)

        // Test Specifications -> Build tests so we know when code is working
        // Important because just running the program may not always be effecient or possible

        // Implementation -> Write the methods/code it
