	List VS Array

	(List is an extension of array, which is a base data structure based on index concept). 
	
	List is better for frequent insertion and deletion. 
	It's not predefined in length and has methods that allow adding or removing elements.
	However, it's slower to access an element from a List (this is based on the position of the element). 
	It's also not index based in the memory, the elements are not necccesarily next to eachother. 
	
	Arrays are fixed in length and do not support methods for insertion or deletion from the current Array.
	The consequence is that they're much smaller and faster than lists.
	The data is stored contiguously (next or toghether in a sequence),
	first element is lowest in index of array and last element is highest. 
	However, resizing an Array is very expensive. 
	
	Where Lists are better at frequent insertion and deletion,
	Arrays are much faster for frequent access or lookup of data inside.
